# CGnetsw-Patch
A Python script for IDA to solve the inconvenience caused by network disconnection during the use of CGnetsw.exe application. Using C language for file reading and writing patch doesnâ€™t seem to be as compatible with every version, while the IDA Python script appears to be a better choice.

## Use guide


Select Script from the menu bar in IDA.
